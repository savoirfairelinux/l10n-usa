    'description': """
        This module allows you to reverse the manufacturing process in OpenERP.  When a product has a bill of materials that defines it components, with mrp_disassemble, a user can go into the Product page and reverse the manufacturing process to gain the product's components.  It handles all of the stock moves for the user, and completes the manufacturing order without a necessary process.  There is an addition to the recepition of goods into the warehouse that allows users to disassemble all of the products that have been purchased.  Sometimes known as dekitting.

                Use case: company orders a fully assembled bicycle from a supplier. They break the item down and sell the parts individually.
