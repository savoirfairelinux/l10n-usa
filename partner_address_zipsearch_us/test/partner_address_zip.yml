  In order to test Partner's address validation zip search features, I create partner's address record having city, longitude, latitude, etc details. 
-
  I modify the record of partner's company with lzipmatch and check this box because I enter zip codes with addresses and it populate city/state/longitude/latitude.
-
  !record {model: res.company, id: base.main_company}:
    lzipmatch: True
- 
  I create record for partner's address details having city name, latitude, longitude, state, zipcode data.
- 
  !record {model: address.zip, id: address_zip_0}:
    city: Detroit
    latitude: '42.33143'
    longitude: '-83.04575'
    state_id: base.state_us_1
    zipcode: '35004'
